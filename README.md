<h1>Simple Bank</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is a simple Bank Terminal Program that does the basic functions of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Withdrawing Money</li>
	<li>Depositing Money</li>
	<li>Applying for Accounts</li>
	<li>Managing Accounts</li>
	<li>Displaying Customer and their Account Information</li>
</ul>
<p> A more detailed skeleton of the program will follow with complete comments. But for now, it can be test run </p>
<h2>Build / Run</h2>
<p>The program is pure java without need for addons. My java version is 11.0.1 so in case something goes wrong, that might be it. </p>
<p>There is a data.xml file you should have in another folder 'cabinet' inside your project folder. It is included in the git files but if you don't have it, create it so it is available.</p>
<p>The program runs in a Terminal as stated.</p>
